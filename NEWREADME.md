## Technologies Used
The YelpQueryMaster application comprised two major components - the user interface and database. The followings are the technologies used during the development of YelpQueryMaster application:
- **C# WPF**: a programming framework used to implement user interfaces
- **PostgresQL**: a database management system used to maintain database
- **SQL**: Structured Query Language (SQL) used to retrieve and post data to the database
- **Npgsql**: middleware that enable C# to access the database.


## Software Architecture

Components for the entire YelpQueryMaster system can be describe as 4 modules
- C# WPF User Interface
- PostgreSQL database 
- SQL trigger
- SQL function

### C# WPF User Interface
The C# WPF user interface is a crucial component of the YelpQueryMaster application, as it presents the data retrieved from the database in a graphical format for the user's convenience. The user interface leverages the capabilities of the WPF framework to provide an intuitive and visually appealing display of the data. The interface acts as the bridge between the database and the end-user, presenting the information in a way that is easy to understand and interact with.

### PostgresSQL Database
The PostgresSQL component of the YelpQueryMaster application plays a vital role in ensuring the integrity and reliability of the data stored within the database. This component is responsible for maintaining the data, ensuring its availability and consistency. The use of PostgresQL as the database management system provides robust and scalable data storage capabilities, allowing the YelpQueryMaster application to efficiently manage large amounts of data. The PostgresSQL component acts as the backbone of the YelpQueryMaster, providing a secure and stable foundation for data storage and management.

### SQL Trigger
The SQL Trigger component of the YelpQueryMaster application plays a crucial role in ensuring the integrity of the data during user interactions. This component trigger certain actions in response to specific events, such as check in to the restaurant and add tip to the restaurant. The SQL Trigger component serves as an automated safety mechanism, verifying the validity of data before it is processed and stored in the database. This helps to prevent potential errors or inconsistencies, and ensures that the data stored in the database remains accurate and consistent. The SQL Trigger component is an integral part of the YelpQueryMaster, working behind the scenes to maintain data integrity and provide a seamless user experience.

### SQL Function
The SQL Function component of the YelpQueryMaster application is a critical component that plays a crucial role in the calculation of distances between a logged-in user and millions of restaurants. This component leverages the power of SQL to perform complex calculations with high performance and efficiency. The use of SQL Functions providing users with accurate and relevant information in real-time. The decision to use SQL Functions was made to ensure fast and reliable performance, ensuring a seamless and efficient user experience.
